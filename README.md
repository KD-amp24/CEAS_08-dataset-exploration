# CEAS_08-dataset-exploration
This is an extensive exploration and analysis of the CEAS_08 Phishing Email dataset from Kaggle.
The Python pipeline uses Pandas for data manipulation, Seaborn for visualizations, and WordCloud for generating visual representations of text data.
The pipeline must be run from the same directory as the dataset. Alternatively, the full path to the dataset can be inserted in the main function (indicated in code).
This is a required exercise in the Information Systems and Development Project (CSC 590-80) course at Jackson State University.
